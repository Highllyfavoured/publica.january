    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Challenge: Build a Content Creation Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Create a collaborative multi-agent system that transforms raw ideas into polished blog posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a **3-agent pipeline** using the collaborative (handoff) pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Brainstormer Agent**\n",
    "   - Tool: `generate_ideas(topic: str) -> str`\n",
    "   - Generates 3-5 key points about the topic\n",
    "   - Returns bullet points of ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Writer Agent**  \n",
    "   - Tool: `draft_content(ideas: str) -> str`\n",
    "   - Takes ideas and writes a draft blog post\n",
    "   - Returns structured content with intro, body, conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Editor Agent**\n",
    "   - Tool: `improve_writing(draft: str) -> str`\n",
    "   - Polishes the draft for clarity and flow\n",
    "   - Returns final polished version\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define your tools** - Create the 3 tools above (simulated output is fine)\n",
    "2. **Create custom state** - What fields do you need to pass between agents?\n",
    "3. **Build the 3 agents** - Each with `llm.bind_tools([...])` and tool invocation logic\n",
    "4. **Construct the graph** - Linear pipeline: brainstormer → writer → editor\n",
    "5. **Test it** - Try: \"Create a blog post about machine learning\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ All 3 agents have tools bound  \n",
    "✅ State passes information through the pipeline  \n",
    "✅ Each agent invokes its tool  \n",
    "✅ Final output is polished content  \n",
    "✅ Graph compiles and runs without errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add a 4th agent** - Fact-checker that validates claims\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start by copying the collaborative pattern structure\n",
    "- Keep tools simple - they can return hardcoded examples\n",
    "- Test each agent individually before connecting them\n",
    "- Use print statements to see the pipeline flow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do it yourself. Good luck!** 🚀"
