    "### Exercise 2: Plan-Execute + Reflection Hybrid\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Combine Plan-Execute and Reflection patterns to create a high-quality multi-step agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept:** Use Plan-Execute to break down complex tasks, then use Reflection on the final output to ensure quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "1. Create a hybrid state that includes:\n",
    "   - Plan-Execute state (input, plan, current_step, results)\n",
    "   - Reflection state (draft, critique, iterations)\n",
    "2. Flow: Planner → Executor (loop) → Generator (uses results) → Critic → Refiner (if needed) → Finalizer\n",
    "3. The Generator creates initial output from all executor results\n",
    "4. The Critic evaluates the complete output (not individual steps)\n",
    "5. Refine the final output based on critique (max 2 reflection iterations)\n",
    "6. Track both execution progress AND reflection quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "START\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "Planner (creates plan)\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "Executor (executes each step)\n",
    "  ↓ (loops until all steps done)\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "Generator (synthesizes results into draft)\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "Critic (evaluates quality)\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "Should Refine?\n",
    "  ↓              ↓\n",
    "Refiner       Finalizer\n",
    "  ↓              ↓\n",
    "Critic         END\n",
    "  (loops)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test scenario:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Task: \"Research the benefits of Python programming, create a summary, and make it beginner-friendly\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected flow:\n",
    "1. PLAN: \n",
    "   - Step 1: Search for Python benefits\n",
    "   - Step 2: Identify key benefits\n",
    "   - Step 3: Create summary\n",
    "2. EXECUTE: Complete all steps\n",
    "3. GENERATE: Create initial summary from results\n",
    "4. REFLECT: Critique summary for beginner-friendliness\n",
    "5. REFINE: Simplify language and add examples\n",
    "6. FINAL: High-quality, beginner-friendly summary\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**\n",
    "1. Combined state definition (TypedDict)\n",
    "2. All necessary nodes (planner, executor, generator, critic, refiner, finalizer)\n",
    "3. Graph with proper edges and conditional routing\n",
    "4. Test with the scenario above\n",
    "5. Print output showing:\n",
    "   - The plan\n",
    "   - Each execution step\n",
    "   - Initial draft\n",
    "   - Critique\n",
    "   - Refined version (if applicable)\n",
    "   - Final output\n",
